Given the following Image, you will transcribe the text word by word to latex. Follow this schema:

\section{2-3 Word short descriptive title for task}
\vspace{-1.5em}
Task Description from image
{\color{blue}
}

The task Numbering will be done automatically via other latex commands that already exists. You have only to give a really short 2-3 word descriptive title for the task in the section{} and copy the task itself word by word.
